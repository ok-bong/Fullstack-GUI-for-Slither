# Smart Contract Audit System

The objective of this project is to develop a web platform for auditing Solidity smart contracts using Slither. Slither serves as a static analysis framework/tool specifically designed for Solidity, the programming language used for implementing smart contracts across various blockchain platforms.

## Setup/Deployment

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### OPTION 1: Using Docker Compose (RECOMMENDED)

To run the Smart Contract Audit System using Docker Compose, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project root directory.

2. Run the following command to build and start the containers:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

3. Access the frontend at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Upon accessing this URL, you'll be directed to the home page of the Smart Contract Audit System.

4. Use the upload form on the frontend to submit a Solidity smart contract file (`.sol`) for auditing. Simply drag and drop the file onto the designated area to initiate the auditing process.

5. The backend will run static analysis via Slither and save the results to the database.

6. Audit reports for each submission can be viewed on the **Report History** page. To access this page, locate and click on the "Report History" link in the navigation bar.

7. To stop the containers, use `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where Docker Compose is running, and then run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

#### Running Slither inside Docker container (Optional)

If you need to run Slither commands inside the backend container, you can use the following steps:

1. Access the backend container:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec backend bash
    ```

2. Once inside the container, you can run Slither commands. For example:

    ```bash
    solc-select install 0.8.4
    solc-select use 0.8.4 
    slither contract.sol --checklist > result.md
    ```

### OPTION 2: No Docker

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- Python 3

#### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

#### Backend

```bash
cd backend
pip3 install virtualenv
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

On wins: ```Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process``` (only if have error: cannot run scripts due to restricted permissions)

**Note:**

- MacOS use: ```source venv/bin/activate```
- Windows use: ```venv\Scripts\activate```

### Usage

The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

There are 3 .sol files within **test_sol_files** for testing purposes.

Use the upload form to submit a solidity smart contract file (.sol) for auditing.

The backend will run static analysis via Slither and save results to the database.

Audit reports for each submission can be viewed on the **Report History** page.

### Documentation

- Backend API documentation is available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs)
